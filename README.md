# Raspberry-Pi Semester Project
## Rover robot obstacle detection with realtime route map plotting
This project is based on Raspberry pi 3B
## Hardware Used:
* Stepper Motors x2
* UltraSonic Sensors
* Breadboard 
* Pi cam(If recording video)
* Resistors/jumper wires
* Custom tyres and body
* Led Lights If needed

## Software Used:
* Python programming Language 3
* MatplotLib
* Numpy
* OpenCV (If recording realtime video)

## Description
* The rover robot is made up of stepper motors, ultra sonic sensors. The stepper motors have been used to record the steps taken by each tyre in a certain direction that leads to mathematical calculation for indicating the direction in real time. The robot moves on its a own like a lawn mover or vaccum clearner robot, sense the obstacles coming in its path and avoids them by changing the route. The body has been customly made so are tyres.
